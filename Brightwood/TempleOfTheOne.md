### Guard Room

A small sitting area for the guards of the front door and prison cell.

3 bandits including the patrolling guard.

### Torture Area

A small child sized chair with shackles on each arm sits at the center of this area which is covered in blood. Either that Fae you saw outside has been tortured for months, or it is not the first Fae that these bandits have captured.

### Cell Door

A path leads down from the area with the chair that ends with a cell door. The door is locked and requires a dc 20 theives tools check or the key off of the bandit captain at 12.

The most intense memories get unraveled into wisps of emotion and infused into the wine.

To the right you smell nothing and hear nothing. 

The first fork that the PC's travel down will have 2 bandits and the second fork will have the bandit captain alone.
