# Thomas Boulderdown 

The *New* Head Barbarian of the Adventurers College.

A 38 year old male human barbarian, he has short, dark hair shaved on both sides and brilliant green eyes. Incredibly muscular with that weirdly tight skin of someone who has very little body fat.
He has a square, asymmetrical face, and a large scar over his right eye. 

He gestures profusely during a conversation.
