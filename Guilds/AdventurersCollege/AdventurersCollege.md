# Buildings

## Hall Of Heros (Adventurers College)

The Hall of Heros is huge cathedral dedicated to honoring the living and dead heros of the Adventurers College. 

As you walk down the hall towards the auditorium, the massive stone representations of heros past and present weight on you the same way it did when you first walked down this hall on the very first day you entered the college. Echos of the first speech you heard from Arch-Mage Caskbow ring in your ear: "If you make it as an adventurer, not only will you have power, fame, and fortune. You will have a chance to be remembered in this hall for all time".

One of the later statues is of a small gnomish man wearing nothing but a loin cloth and carrying what is, for a gnome, a massive two handed sword.

## Arena (Adventurers College)

The Arena is where most of the martial combat training takes place, weirdly enough the Clerics are the ones who run the building and spend the most time there, because their class time is mostly spend patching up combatants.

## Mage Towers (Adventurers College)

The Mage Towers are where Arch-Mage Caskbow and Kaylein help wizards research spells lore or natural spell casters control their natural magic. There tends to be a bit of a rivalry between the Wizards and the natural spell casters, so Caskbow and Kaylein try to keep them apart.

## Mcneary Hall (Adventurers College)

Mcneary Hall is the first year dorms for the College. 

## Bards Palace (Adventurers College)

The Bards Palace is where the bards go to train their skills of performance and persuasion. Easily the nicest building on the entire campus.

## Druids Circle (Adventurers College)

The Druids Circle is as close as you can get to a druid commune inside a city. It smells a bit like an animal farm, but it is always the location of the best parties.

## Rangers Cabin (Adventurers College)

The Rangers Cabin is an incredibly organized, efficient, purposeful place of learning.

## Fighters Lodge (Adventurers College)

The Fighters Lodge looks less like a place of learning and more like military barracks. Many Militaries with treaties with Calavan send officers here to audit classes, bringing at least some of Colleges knowledge back.

## Barbarians Castle (Adventurers College)

One would assume that the barbarians castle would be a place of rage, hate, and violence, but in reality it is a tranquil place of calm and meditation. The difficulty of being a successful barbarian is simply to control the rage, not to fuel it.

## Caskbow Manor (Adventurers College)

Roger Caskbow is the only instructor to have a residence on the north side of town, his manor sits on the river and its only rival in town is the Council Estate.
