# Initial Story:

The campaign will start with all of the PC's as graduating members of the Adventurers Guild in Calavan. 

When they get their assignments they will learn that they have been relegated to be protectors of Camtrie. This tiny settlement exists in totality as a rest stop for merchant caravans and travelers traveling south along the road from Calavan towards Starvein.

Is this assignment a punishment? Is there something the PC's don't know? We will find out.
