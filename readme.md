## Harvest Festival Contest
Today is an important day of they year for the City of Orchards. The Harvest Festival importantly marks the renewal day for the spring pact, but before the regrowth ceremony takes place the tournament winner must be picked. 

Last year your adventuring party got within one point of winning, but lost to Heather and the Gary's and Heather did NOT let you guys forget it.
