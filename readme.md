You are all standing in Garden Square a good distance from the stage for Calavan Idol as Marty rejoins the party.

Looking for any changes to the square you see:

Towards the center of the square where there is normally a large perpetually blosoming cherry tree you see three standing stones in a line with Kaylein standing in front.

Behind that you see a row of three new additions to the square:

Off in the corner you see a new stand built with what from this distance looks like barrels maybe?

Next to that you see some people taking shots at archery targets

And next to that you see Kul Gutfrul sweeping straw into a pile, next too a few scare crows stacked up against a wall.

Bilar Ceimar owns 50% of the town
2 Wolves
Tevin 5
1 wolf
Marty 12
Aludra 17

Why do musicians make great scavengers? They're always luting.
How do dragons rate their satisfaction with their lives? On a scale.
Why do Rogues wear Leather? Because it's made out of Hide.

Mix red (blood) and blue (sky) potions to get purple (royal hue) potion.
Drink the purple potion. This potion will invoke temporary blindness to that player (night descend).
The purple potion will refill in the beaker it was drunk from (fills anew).
Mix yellow (sun) and blue (sea) potions to get green (grass) potion.
Drink green potion. This will invoke temporary deafness for that player (hushed it's voice).
The green potion will refill in the beaker it was drunk from (refill completeness).
Mix the purple (royal) and green (grass) potions together.
Drink this potion. This potion will cure blindness and deafness caused by other potions and also the Death Cloud virus. It will also refill so all players can be cured.

I cover cities and destroy mountains,
I make men blind, yet help them see.

It holds most knowledge that has ever been said;
But is not the brain, is not the head.
To feathers and their masters, â€™tis both bane and boon. . .
One empty, and one full.
