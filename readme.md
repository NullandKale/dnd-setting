You are all standing in Garden Square a good distance from the stage for Calavan Idol as Marty rejoins the party.

Looking for any changes to the square you see:

Towards the center of the square where there is normally a large perpetually blosoming cherry tree you see three standing stones in a line with Kaylein standing in front.

Behind that you see a row of three new additions to the square:

Off in the corner you see a new stand built with what from this distance looks like barrels maybe?

Next to that you see some people taking shots at archery targets

And next to that you see Kul Gutfrul sweeping straw into a pile, next too a few scare crows stacked up against a wall.

Bilar Ceimar owns 50% of the town

# Next Session:

Gate House:
Moss and ivy creep up the walls of the ancient castle. Its stone has stood for generations, and even as no one sits inside the walls they stand strong.

As you pass by you see a blacksmiths forge. You see something poking out of the fire. The Blackened Crossbow.

Barracks:
The guard barracks are kept in a neat if not exacting state: beds made, footlockers shut, spears and swords alike placed neatly within their cupboards to ensure safe handling. A plain wooden table sits in the middle of the room between some bunks, several hands of playing cards tossed carelessly across its surface.

Sitting besides the largest and most prominent bunk in the room is a large battle axe with the same sigil as Trisbella's armor. Underneath is a book with the same sigil.

Stables:
The barn doors open to reveal several stalls—two with horses sticking their heads over the half-doors—a loft low on hay, saddles on stands, and tack on the walls. A stablegirl exits and carries a coil of rope toward a short row of outdoor stalls under a thatched roof. In one, a tall, dappled mare whinnies and paws the ground with her hoof.

Penny & Steve
Both horses are alive and know little of what happened, all they saw is the stable master, fizz-scrottle was standing outside and froze in place, then a pair of bandits came by and picked him up and placed him in a cart full of other frozen bandits. Penny and Steve ask to be let out to roam the country side free. They went off towards the well.

As you let penny out she comes up besides you and shows you a blade sticking out of the side of her pack "Can you take this?"

Well:
You see cart tracks around the well.

Crops:
The fields of crops are almost exclusively wine grapes, once finely cultivated and managed it now looks like someone took a cart and drove through it.

Great Hall
Long tables and benches line the sides of this high-ceilinged chamber, leaving a wide central walkway to approach the raised table at the far end. Several high-backed chairs stand behind it, and a vast mural covers the wall. As with the tapestries that decorate the other walls, the mural depicts a wild fae landscape, hunting parties and their quarry, and fruitful gardens, but it also uses the height of wall to display mountains and a high circular window to serve as the sun.

Kitchen
Myriad smells simultaneously clash and mingle in the fragrant steam spilling from the massive kitchen. Butter, oil, garlic, aromatic herbs, sharp spices—all war for dominance of your senses. Flames lick at copper pots, simmering with sauces and stocks, however no chefs bustle along the line of hissing pans, no hands hold the knives that gleam in the distance.

A familiar smell hits your nose, not a smell any normal chef would know, a poisonous smell. As you search for the location of this smell you see a sickely green kitchen knife

Chapel: 
Outside you hear a magical call:
Come one, Come All to the best place in the whole human world for games of chance and delight. A place where the faerie fire and drinks never end. A place of wonder.
Welcome to the :
Divine Gambling Hall of a Goddess of Misfortune

You a certain compulsion that you will win from the moment you enter. You see bright lights, wheels of faerie fire, and colorful banners. Invisible magic servents move about with flagons and trays of different colored drinks off to hand drinks to non-existant customers. The festive music of an enormous orchestra fills the gambling hall, eminating from enchanted set of band instruments.

To the right of the entrance you see the place where the they exchange gold coins for the chips used in the casino. The door is ajar and inside is a bright elvish scimitar.

To the left is a strangely familiar sight, Pete sitting behind his bar. As you walk up you feel yourself enter a very familiar location, the sounds of the slimey bottle seem to sit in the background of your consiousness 

Castle Keep:

Why do musicians make great scavengers? They're always luting.
How do dragons rate their satisfaction with their lives? On a scale.
Why do Rogues wear Leather? Because it's made out of Hide.

Mix red (blood) and blue (sky) potions to get purple (royal hue) potion.
Drink the purple potion. This potion will invoke temporary blindness to that player (night descend).
The purple potion will refill in the beaker it was drunk from (fills anew).
Mix yellow (sun) and blue (sea) potions to get green (grass) potion.
Drink green potion. This will invoke temporary deafness for that player (hushed it's voice).
The green potion will refill in the beaker it was drunk from (refill completeness).
Mix the purple (royal) and green (grass) potions together.
Drink this potion. This potion will cure blindness and deafness caused by other potions and also the Death Cloud virus. It will also refill so all players can be cured.

I cover cities and destroy mountains,
I make men blind, yet help them see.
