# Taking the Great Egg Back

Now that the harvest festival is over, the great egg is devoid of its life giving power, and needs to be returned to the Druids of Brightwood. 

Arch-Mage Caskbow sits on the front of his desk and places his hand on the great egg. As your final quest you will be returning the Great Egg to the druids for safe keeping and recharging. At the center of the Brightwoods is a druid camp, Camp Full Moon, you will trek into the brightwoods to Camp Full Moon and deliver the egg to Elias Folen, the Druid Chief.

The way is long, around 1 week of travel there and 1 week back, you will need to pack provisions, camping supplies, and should be prepared for the wild life. Wolves and the like tend to be more ambitious during these months as they prepare for winter. But I think you all can handle it.

## First encounter: Merchants leaving Calavan for Starvein

As you are leaving the city you notice a cart pulled by two large horses, with a Dark Elf driver and a posh looking man sitting next to her.

Mardem Zidul -- Potion Merchant Human 40s

3 potions of healing 25 GP
1 potion of haste 50 GP
5 potions of acid splash 10 GP

Tel Peacekiller -- Dark Elf guard 200 ish? 
Gruff, doesnt want to talk, just wants to get back on the road

## If they go to fast:

3 wolves attack on the road. If that seems easy as the last one dies it howls for another 3 wolves to join.

## Second encounter: Awakened Forest

As you leave your first days camp you feel a sparkle of arcane energy in the air. 

2 Awakened Shrubs MM 317 and 1 Awakened Tree MM 317 attack.

After the fight an arcana, perception, or insight check tells more info about the the attack. 
Someone did this.
This kind of magic is an antithesis to what druids beleive, twisting nature like this is evil. 
A spell like this would not last forever, either it was done right before the group stopped to camp and they luckily were missed by the awakened plants or it was done during the night. 
It seems like it was a trap.
