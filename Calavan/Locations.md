## The Council Estate

The Council controls all of the commerce that goes into or out of Calavan, this Estate is a testament to their extreme wealth. More servants live on the estate grounds than the Council members and their families combined

## The Fields

This space was originally the location of the orchards of Calavan. After the Spring Pact allowed for rapid growth in production and wealth the upper class in Calavan started building large manors. The only trees left here were left to decorate the area, and obscure the manors from each other.

## Ubano Temple

A Temple to the Quilt Weaver Ubano, god of creation and time. 

## Boulderdown Residence

Until recently this was the home of Frederick Serpentwind, but as he has been missing for a few months it is now the home of Thomas Boulderdown. A large single room house with a large firepit running through the center of the room. In the backyard he has two chicken coops and a small shed.

## T'alrai Embassy

The Elvish republic maintains an embassy here run by Qinhorn T'alrai and Dara T'alrai. The ambassadors daughter Inding is Head Cleric at the college. 

## Cloudfang Residence

The Cloudfang residence is a modest house for a war hero like Ella, but then again she is rather young.

## Goldback Residence

Thain spends any time he has not teaching in the slimy bottle singing to the patrons... and drinking. Because of this his house is almost always empty.

## Relics Residence

Fourteen Relics, like most tabaxi, LOVES things. This is evident from her house which is filled to the brim with everything from empty bottles to ancient relics. 

## The Slimy Bottle

A magical door with a green glowing sign on top that seems to drip slime that says "The Slimy Bottle". Upon opening the door you see a huge room with a few dozen tables and a bar at the back. The amount and diversity of the patrons is staggering even for a city like Calavan. At the back is Pete, a giant green slime that stands mute waiting for orders from patrons. As you walk in you a patron standing in front of Pete silently toss a gold coin into his slimy mass. After this happens Pete starts to ascend the back wall. As you get a better look you see that all 4 walls are filled with small cubbies, some lined with frost, some with coals, but all containing at least a few bottles. Pete returns and happily spits for lack of a better word a slimy bottle into the patrons hand. After wiping it of with a towel on the bar, they look overjoyed with pete's selection and return happily to their table. 

## Garden Square

A place in town dedicated to the rest and relaxation of the residents, but during the harvest festival it is filled to the brim with people, booths from local restaurants and shops, and contest locations.

## Docks

Pretty standard docks and warehouses. Where most of the packaged goods are stored before they leave for other parts of the worlds. These docks provide food for almost 40% of the continents peoples.

## The Pit Mine

An old abandoned mine on the outskirts of town. It is now used as a dump for agricultural waste.
