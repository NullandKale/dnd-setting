### Tel' ni sehan : TELL KNEE SAY HAN (Elvish: The short walk)

Kaylein Cleves hosts this contest, standing in front of the middle of the three standing stones, each about 8 ft tall.

As you approch, a gust of freezing cold air comes bursting out of the space left of Kaylein as Mertel Frear falls out of a portal, covered in snow. Kaylein stops a small gnomish stopwatch and records the result.

As you walk into the space between the standing stones you feel a tug at your clothes, and then feel what you could only describe as a tug on your soul as you are pulled from your current location to a new one. 

You appear in a cave, dimly lit by glowing orange pink mushrooms on the cave sides. (with dark vision or a dc 15 -> dc 10 -> dc 5 perception or survival check) you see a pair of standing stones around 60 ft down the cave.

You appear in a birch forest, dense with trees, and with a canopy that almost fully blocks out the sky, casting the forest in a green glow. (with dc 15 -> dc 10 -> dc 5 perception or survival check) You find the standing stones.

You appear in a frozen wasteland, nothing but ice and sky for as far as you can see, the absolute bone chilling cold whips around you, distracting you from your goal. do a dc 15 survival check or con check. or be frozen, speed halved, and 1d6 damage taken.

As you bring your mind back on task, except maybe, in the distance, a pair of standing stones.
