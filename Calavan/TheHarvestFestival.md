# The Harvest Festival

Once a year on November 30th the harvest festival takes place. A day of tournaments, concerts, and celebrations. Culminating in the rebirth ceremony, where a yearly gift from the druids of brightwood refuel the spring pact.

The Adventurers College runs the tournament, with a few of the instructors running the individual contests.

Each contest awards 3 points to first place, 2 points to second place, and 1 point to third place. Whatever team has the most points at the end of the contest wins.

## Non-combat contests

### Calavan Idol.

Run by Thain Goldback, the worlds worst MC, but if they don't make him MC he will compete and win. The College doesnt need anther 50 year winning streak, but the audience REALLY wants it.

Each contestant gets on stage and performs for the crowd, one at a time. The crowd then votes on who they like best. Magic optional but recommended.

Roll 10d6, for each magical action that the contestant can conjure add 1d6 and drop the lowest roll.

Highest rolls win.

### Pie barreling contest. (str and dex)

Run by Roger Caskbow, pie is his favorite.

This contest involves teams of two. One unboxes the pies and hands them to the one who throws the pies into a barrel. Heaviest barrel after 100 seconds wins.

Set a timer for 100 seconds.

1. The unboxer must make a dc 10 str or dex check, until they make the dc the thrower cannot throw.
2. Then the thrower must make a dc 15 dex check to make it in the barrel. 
3. Repeat counting the throwers successes.

### Walnut hunt. (insight, stealth, and slight of hand)

Just finding this contest is the first hurdle. Fourteen Relics is drinking at the bar, and the player must pass a dc 10 charisma check to find out about the contest.

Someone in the crowd has a single ruby walnut in their pocket. First team to steal it wins. 

15+ insight to find the person.
opposed stealth check to not be seen.
If you are seen you get disadvantage on the slight of hand check, advantage if you are in stealth.

As there is only one winner, this contest awards 5 points.

## Combat contests
