The Brightwood forest is a large forest temperate forest. Due to the almost supernatural density of the vegetation very little of the forest has been explored. According to local legend there is a clan of druids who live in the center, being born, living, and dying entirely inside the deepest reaches of the forest.

There are two cities located on the edges of the Brightwood forest, Calavan in the [Republic of Fayfall](/Fayfall.md) and Starvein in the [Kingdom of Alomar](/Alomar.md). 

In ancient times The Empire carved a road all the way from the north of the continent to the south, likely to move its massive army as it colonized the continent in its entirety. This road cuts through brightwood forest between Calavan and Starvein.

Both the [Republic of Fayfall](/Fayfall.md) and the [Kingdom of Alomar](/Alomar.md) agree that a border runs through the center of the forest. However, the only evidence of this border is two opposing "Welcome to" signs on the road between Calavan and Starvein.

## Camtrie - A nothing town.
* Population: 100
* Government: None
* Guard: The towns people with pitchforks and scythes.

Camtrie sits in the middle of the road from Calavan to Starvein. This tiny settlement exists in totality as a rest stop for merchant caravans and travelers traveling south along the road from Calavan towards Starvein.

## Calavan - The city of orchards.

* Population: 15,000
* Government: Plutocracy (The council of orchardists)
* Guard: The Apple Blossoms
* Notable City Specific Factions:
  * The council of orchardists
  * The Adventurers College
  * Unnamed thieves guild
  * Pickers (guild of unskilled orchard workers)

Calavan is nestled between the edge of the forest and the Romdover river.

Calavan started as a farming town. The land north of the Brightwood forest being extremely fertile and extremely flat proved to be the perfect place to plant orchards. This investment by the original settlers paid huge dividends and the orchards still provide a large portion of the food for the population of the [Republic of Fayfall](/Fayfall.md) and the [Kingdom of Alomar](/Alomar.md).

Calavan is now a city with two faces. When most think of Calavan they think of the Adventurers College but most of the population in Calavan exist to support the orchards. The College is immensely diverse, filled with all the species of the world. This is a stark contrast to the non-college population which is 

### The council of orchardists

The council of orchardists own almost everything in Calavan. While they are technically part of the [Republic of Fayfall](/Fayfall.md) with a "democratically" elected Mayor, only land owners are allowed to vote and the only land owners are the council of orchardists.

### The Adventurers College

A majority of the adventurers in the continent come from the college. Those who choose to risk their lives for fame, gold, magic, or some combination of all three travel from far and wide to learn the trade. It is a common misconception that students at the college are young, the opposite is actually true, it is rare for a young person to be so desperate as to want to adventure for a living. The college boasts a 10 year survival rate of 5%! Learn more on the dedicated [Adventurers College](/Guilds//AdventurersCollege.md) page.

### Unnamed thieves guild

Hidden in the shadows is a lose federation of thieves and fences that operate in the underworld of Calavan. They also operate a black market that deals in anything illegal: drugs, illicit potions, alchemical ingredients, etc.

## Starvein - The stone city

* Population: 25,000
* Government: Monarchy (The Count of Starvein)
* Guard: The Counts men
* Notable City Specific Factions:
  * The nobility of Starvein
  * Transport Guild
  * Merchant Guild

Starvein sits just past the white pass of the Jagged Mountains along the banks of the Crystal River. Huge docks sit in the river allowing mountains of goods to pass into and out of the region. As much Goods and Gold flow through the Crystal River as water.

Starvein was originally the dwarven settlement of Dueegar but after the globalization caused by The Empire thousands of years ago more and more peoples moved to Starvein. Now the population of Starvein is 30% dwarven, 20% elven, 25% human, and 25% "other".

While a large portion of the food for the region comes from Calavan, almost ALL the goods move through Starvein.
